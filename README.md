# Shishim ve Arba / שישים וארבע

## Overview
A Hebrew font for the Commodore 64.

Latin + numbers based on the original from the Commodore. The Hebrew portion was designed by me.

## Wait, are you serious?

Yeah, I'm serious. This was originally a part of my other project, [Good Night Macy](http://www.goodnightmacy.com) but I spun it off.

## Is this font ready for production?

*No*. But I'm working on it.

## Specimen?

I don't have anything serious as of right now. But I did make a few procedurally generated "demos":

* [The first one](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFnvnKMRO0H/)
* [The second in the series](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFqeiZ9ROw8/)
* [The third one](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFrZgBBRO_B/)
* [A fourth demo](https://www.instagram.com/p/BFzYIU0RO2k/)

I will eventually make "proper" specimen.
